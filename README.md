# School_District_Analysis

## Background

For this module, we analyzed 2 interlinked datasets on Schools and Students to help drive meaningful insights into improving facilities within schools based on test results and also with budget allocation. The school dataset comprised of :

        School ID, 
        School Name ,
        School Type (Public of Charter) , 
        Number of students currently enrolled in the school
        Budget allocated for the running of the school.
        
The Student dataset comprised of :
        Student ID, 
        Student Full Name, 
        Gender (M or F), 
        Grade (9th,10th,11th,12th), 
        School Name, 
        Reading scores 
        Math scores secured by the student.
        
### Overview 

This analysis was performed on 39,170 students belonging to 15 different schools. The student dataset comprises of students from the 9th,10th,11th and 12th grade and the marks scored by these students. This dataset helped analyze the best performing schools in each grade based on scores of students within that school. It also helped calculate the average scores by school and by grade. Analysis of this dataset would help government officials to make updates to already assigned budgets based on the need of the school. This dataset could also help analyze if any one gender outbeat the other gender across schools.

### Results 

As part of the analysis, a small subset of students were removed from the analysis. The 9th Graders from Thomas High School were excluded from the analysis and below are some observations from comparing the results of the full subset vs a slightly smaller subset :
    
* The overall Math,Reading,Math and Reading pass percentages across all schools and all the students did not change significantly after excluding the 9th graders from     Thomas High School 
* The percentage of students from Thomas High School that passed Math dropped by approxiamtely 26% after exluding the 9th graders
* The percentage of students from Thomas High School that passed Reading dropped by approxiamtely 26% after excluding the 9th graders
* The percentage of students from Thomas High School that passed both Math and Reading dropped by approxiamtely 35% after excluding the 9th graders
